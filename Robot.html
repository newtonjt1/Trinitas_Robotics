<p> Bit is the robot that will be controlling Squeaky in this year's BEST Robotics competition. Its job is to control Squeaky so that Squeaky can fulfill an order. It is our hope that Bit will suceed in improving work for all assembly line and warehouse workers.</p>

<p> A big advantage with Bit is that he will be able to operate <em>and</em> maintain pieces of equipment and other robots so that humans don't have to risk life and limb doing so. After all, around 40% of injuries and fatalities that occur to warehouse and assembly line workers are caused by the equipment they work with. Bit will fix this problem.
